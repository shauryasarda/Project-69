    <p class="text-muted text-left">The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] located in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel was highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India with a major part of the former British Raj to form the single Union of India. In Gujurat the statue is found on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the city of Vadodara.[4]

      The project was first announced in 2010, and construction of the statue started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹2,700 crore (US$422 million).[5] It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar and was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel's birth.[6]

      History
      Narendra Modi announced the project on 7 October 2013 to mark the beginning of his tenth year as the chief minister of Gujarat.[7]
      
      A society named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) was formed under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, to execute the project.[7][8]
      
      Statue of Unity Movement was started in 2013 to collect the iron needed for the statue by asking farmers to donate their used farming instruments.[7][9] By 2016, a total of 135 metric tonnes of scrap iron had been collected and about 109 tonnes of it was used to make the foundation of the statue after processing.[10] A marathon titled Run For Unity was held on 15 December 2013 in Surat and Vadodara in support of the project.[11]</p>

    <h4>Rain brings nature back to a healthier balance</h4>

<p Rain India brings us life and energy. The monsoon season brings that much-needed relief to the scorched land. However, besides being very refreshing, the heavy rains also provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes and a humid environment, which in turn can lead to rapid spread of microbe-borne diseases. Malaria, dengue, flu, chikungunya, leptospirosis, etc. are some of the common health conditions that pose a threat to your health during the rainy season.

No need to book separate tests for diagnosis now. Book a fever profile test and find what is causing that high temperature or other health symptoms. 

You can only enjoy any season if you and your loved ones are healthy and fit. Here are 7 basic (and no hi fi) health tips to keep you healthy during monsoon:></p></li>
